# Section 3: Common Use Cases

## Stashing
- temporary changes to be place but not committed to the
repository, code is set aside and resets the history to the last commit

## Commit
- added changes to the repo and added new history, can be pushed
to the remote repository at a later time

## Branching
- used for implementing unstable features to the code (prototypes), branch checkout is needed first in order to use that branch

## Merging
- once a branch has its fully implemented functions, one can
merge the working branch (beta) to a master branch (release/main) to be merged later, combining changes from two different branches

## Merge Conflicts
- occurs when two changes are conflicting, requires user
intervention and choosing whether the current branch is going to be used or other feature branch

## Revert/Reverse Commit
- revert commit undos changes done and reverse changes

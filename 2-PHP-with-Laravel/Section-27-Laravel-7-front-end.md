# Laravel 7 - Front-end
- Install package `laravel/ui` by `composer require laravel/ui`
- `php artisan ui bootstrap` to use bootstrap, `vue` for vue and `react` for react for the scaffolding option
- Install NodeJS dependencies and `npm run dev`
- On replacing style css files, use the method `asset()` on the blade page, pointing the file that is inside the `public/` folder and thus making asset URLs dynamic
- For login and registration forms, run `php artisan ui bootstrap --auth`
